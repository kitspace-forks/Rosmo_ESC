# Rosmo ESC


Design for Rosmo ESC - in M5Stack format.

## Pinout

This is **not** the final pinout!

Just playing with the settings and peripherals to see how many pins we will need for 2 motors.

Result: something like 64 pins, although we can probably save some of these like the sensor ABI inputs by sacrificing some functionality.
